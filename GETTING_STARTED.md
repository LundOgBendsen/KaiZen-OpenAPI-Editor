## Installing KaiZen OpenAPI Editor
Follow instructions from the [README File](https://github.com/RepreZen/KaiZen-OpenAPI-Editor#user-content-installing-kaizen-openapi-editor).

## Creating an OpenAPI Spec
1. Open a list of the available creation wizards: **File > New > Other...** .
2. Expand the **KaiZen OpenAPI Editor** category.
3. Choose one of the available options:
    * Choose **Swagger v2 Spec** to create a Swagger-OpenAPI 2.0 specification. This is the current industry-standard API description language, supported by thousands of open source projects and all major API technology vendors. 
    * Choose **OpenAPI v3 Spec** to create an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. This is the first major upgrade to OAS, scheduled for a final release in July 2017. See [OpenAPI 3.0 Editing Support](OPEN_API_V3_SUPPORT.md) for more information on current and planned features.
